<h1> Graph </h1>
<p>Graph algorithms are a set of instructions that traverse (visits nodes of a) graph. Some algorithms are used to find a specific node or the path between two given nodes.</p><br/>
<h1> Breadth First Search </h1>
<p>Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.</p><br/>
<h1> Depth First Search </h1>
<p>Depth-First Search or DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that uses the backtracking principle. It entails conducting exhaustive searches of all nodes by moving forward if possible and backtracking, if necessary. To visit the next node, pop the top node from the stack and push all of its nearby nodes into a stack.</p>
